## Question 2

**Q:** What section of the Act states that the CGST Act now applies to Jammu and Kashmir?

### Answer

The Central Goods and Services Tax (Extension to Jammu and Kashmir) Act, 2017, was enacted to provide for the extension of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 to the State of Jammu and Kashmir [Source: data/raw\cgst-extension-to-jammu-and-kashmir-act_2017.pdf, Page: 0].

Specifically, Section 2, subsection (2), clause (a) of this Act states that in section 1, sub-section (2) of the principal Act, the words “except the State of Jammu and Kashmir” shall be omitted. This omission makes the CGST Act applicable to Jammu and Kashmir [Source: data/raw\cgst-extension-to-jammu-and-kashmir-act_2017.pdf, Page: 1].

## Question 3

**Q:** Which phrase was removed from Section 1(2) of the principal CGST Act in this amendment?

### Answer

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific phrase being removed from Section 1(2) of the principal CGST Act. The documents discuss the repeal of other Acts (like the Central Excise Act, 1944, etc.) in Section 174 and refer to "be omitted" in a manner that doesn't specify an omission from Section 1(2) of the CGST Act itself [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 97].

www.cleartax.com/gst
for Reckitt Benckinser
GST Guidebook-ClearTax
To understand GST , it is important that we understand 
the current indirect taxation system. Direct taxes such as 
income tax are borne by the person liable to pay the tax; 
this means that the tax burden cannot be shifted to any-
one else. The liability of an indirect taxes on the other hand, 
can be shifted to another person. So, the person liable to pay 
the tax can collect the tax from someone else and then pay it 
to the government; thus shifting the tax burden. The GST tax 
falls in this category.
The current indirect tax structure, which comprises of so 
many different taxes, can be classified as:
Central taxes: levied by the Central govt (includes Central 
Sales Tax, Excise Duty etc.)

Medium Enterprises (SMEs) may struggle to comply with 
these provisions. To resolve such scenarios, the government 
has introduced Composition Scheme under GST , which 
is merely an extension of the current scheme under VAT 
law. When opting for the Composition Scheme under GST , 
a taxpayer will be required to file summarized returns on a 
quarterly basis, instead of three monthly returns (as applica-
ble for normal businesses).

## Question 12

**Q:** What are the thresholds for compulsory GST registration?

### Answer

You should obtain GST registration if your aggregate turnover in a financial year exceeds INR 20 lakhs (or INR 10 lakhs for Special category states). However, this condition does not apply if your turnover includes only goods or services that are exempt under GST [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 9].

exemption from registration to specific persons.
Exemption from GST Registration
A person may opt for voluntary registration under GST even 
if he is not liable to be registered. All the provisions of GST 
applicable to a registered taxable person will similarly apply 
to such a voluntarily registered person also, i.e. he will be 
treated as a normal taxable person.
For example, assume there is a small grocery dealer with a 
limited turnover of Rs. 12-15 lakh. Such a dealer may not be 
required to register under GST . However, he may be sup-
plying inputs to a nearby restaurant which has a turnover 
exceeding Rs. 20 lakh, is registered as a normal taxpayer, and 
is thus eligible for input credit. In such a scenario, a small

3.REGISTERING UNDER GST
Important Points to Remember when Now that we know the basics of GST calculation, the process 
of ITC claims and filing of returns, let us look at how a tax-
payer can register for GST . 
If you meet any of the conditions listed below, you should 
obtain your GST registration when the enrollment reopens 
again [GST is expected to apply from 1st July 2017]:
Your aggregate turnover in a financial year exceeds INR 20 
lakhs (INR 10 lakhs for Special category states)\
If your turnover includes supply of only those goods/services 
which are exempt under GST , this clause does not apply
To calculate this threshold, your turnover should include

Goods and Services Tax, however, there is a flip-side to it. 
Businesses registering voluntarily under GST may have to 
face extra compliance and working capital liquidity. Some of 
these consequences are:
Multiple return filing: Businesses registered under Goods and 
Services Taxes are required to file three returns every month. 
These returns are GSTR-1, GSTR-2, GSTR-3 and include the 
details of all purchases, sales, and final tax liability after set-
ting off Input Tax Credit. Failure to file these returns will not 
only deny the input credit to our buyer but also attract pen-
alty. Further Compliance rating will get affected negatively.
Payment of tax liability: Once registered under GST , the 
supplier will have the additional responsibility of collecting

as baseline for using HSN codes of 4 digits. The use of HSN 
codes will make GST systematic and globally accepted. 
For taxpayers with turnover between INR 1.5 Crores and INR 
5 Crores in the preceding financial year, HSN codes may be 
specified only at 2 digit chapter level as an optional exercise 
to start with. From the second year of GST operations, men-
tioning 2 digit chapter level HSN Code will be mandatory 
for all taxpayers whose turnover in previous financial year 
between INR 1.5 Crores and INR 5.0 Crores. Indian author-
ities have further categorized the six digit HSN into two digit 
sub-chapters, thus increasing the total number of digits to 
be eight. This eight-digit code will be mandatory in case of 
export and imports under the GST regime.

Here are the rules for registration for these persons:
     Registration shall be valid for 90 days.
     It can be further extended by 90 days.
     An advance deposit of tax liability for the period of regis

## Question 13

**Q:** What is the meaning of aggregate turnover according to the Act?

### Answer

According to the Act, "aggregate turnover" means the aggregate value of all taxable supplies (excluding the value of inward supplies on which tax is payable by a person on reverse) [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 1].

## Question 14

**Q:** What are the conditions for claiming input tax credit?

### Answer

A registered person is entitled to claim input tax credit (ITC) subject to the following conditions and restrictions:

*   The goods or services or both must be used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of their business [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 18].
*   The amount of credit for goods or services used partly for business and partly for other purposes shall be restricted to the input tax attributable to business purposes [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 19].
*   The person must be in possession of a tax invoice or debit note issued by a registered supplier [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 18].
*   ITC cannot be taken after the due date for furnishing the return under section 39 for the month of September following the end of the financial year to which the invoice or debit note pertains, or after furnishing the relevant annual return, whichever is earlier [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 19].

## Question 16

**Q:** What is the valuation rule for supplies between related persons?

### Answer

For supplies between related persons under GST, the valuation rule is determined as follows:

1.  The Open Market Value (OMV) of the supply will be used, which is the amount fairly available in the open market. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 25]
2.  If the OMV is not available, the value of supply will be that of goods or services of like kind and quantity. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 25]
3.  If the value is not determinable by the above two methods, it shall be determined by either the Cost Method or Residual Method. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 25]
4.  If the recipient of the goods or services (or both) is eligible for full input tax credit, the value declared in the invoice shall be deemed to be the open market value of the goods or services. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 25]

supply shall be: 
Open Market Value of such supply. OMV will be the amount 
which is fairly available in open market.
If the open market value is not available, the value of supply 
will be the sum of the total of consideration in money and 
any such further amount in money as is equivalent to the 
consideration not in money if such amount is known at the 
time of supply. In simple words the monetary value of partial 
consideration will be added to monetary consideration, to 
sum up to total consideration.
If the value is not determinable under the points above, the 
value of supply of goods or service or both will be equivalent 
to that of like kind and quantity. Here the taxable person can 
refer to similar goods or services or both for determining the 
value of supply.

The Open Market Value (OMV) of such supply. OMV will be the 
amount which is fairly available in open market.
If the open market value is not available, it will be the val-
ue of supply of goods or services of like, kind and quantity. 
Here, the taxable person can use as reference similar goods 
or services or both for determining the value of supply.
If the value is not determinable in the above two cases it 
shall be determined by either by the Cost Method or Residual 
Method.

## Question 17

**Q:** What is the cascading effect of taxes described in the GST e-book?

### Answer

The cascading effect of taxes occurs when a tax is paid on another tax, leading to an increase in the value of an item each time this happens [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 4]. Under the previous taxation system, the tax paid on material purchases could not be claimed from the output tax, which contributed to this problem [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 4]. GST aims to solve this by introducing seamless Input Tax Credit (ITC) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 4].

GST is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based 
consumption tax on levied at every stage of value addition 
in the lifecycle of a product. To understand this better, let us 
look at each of the terms in detail:
Comprehensive: GST will subsume all of the current 
indirect taxes. Plus, by bringing in a unified taxation 
system, across the country, it will ensure that there is 
no more arbitrariness in tax rates.
Multi-stage: GST is levied each stage in the supply 
chain, where a transaction takes place. 
Value-addition: This is the process of addition to the 
value of a product/ service at each stage of its pro-
duction, exclusive of initial costs. Under GST , the tax is

To understand GST , it is important that we understand 
the current indirect taxation system. Direct taxes such as 
income tax are borne by the person liable to pay the tax; 
this means that the tax burden cannot be shifted to any-
one else. The liability of an indirect taxes on the other hand, 
can be shifted to another person. So, the person liable to pay 
the tax can collect the tax from someone else and then pay it 
to the government; thus shifting the tax burden. The GST tax 
falls in this category.
The current indirect tax structure, which comprises of so 
many different taxes, can be classified as:
Central taxes: levied by the Central govt (includes Central 
Sales Tax, Excise Duty etc.)

When is Tax Levied?
A taxable event such as manufacture, sale and provision of a 
good has to occur for tax to be collected. Under the current 
system, each taxable event is subject to multiple taxes such 
as excise, VAT/ CST and service tax. But under GST , products 
will no longer have multiple taxes, and will not incur excise 
duty as well as VAT at different points of time. There will 
no longer be any difference between goods and services in 
terms of taxation.
An example of this is when we go out to eat at a restaurant. 
Earlier, the customer paid both VAT and service tax on a 
single bill, but after GST is implemented there will be a single 
tax charge on the bill amount.

(140+30+17) 187 to the customer.
In the end, every time an individual was able to claim in-
put tax credit, the sale price for him reduced and the cost 
price for the person buying his product reduced because 
of a lower tax liability. The final value of the shirt also 
therefore reduced from INR 214.5 to INR 187, thus reducing 
the tax burden on the final customer.
So essentially, GST is going to have a two-pronged benefit. 
One, it will reduce the cascading effect of taxes, and second, 
by allowing input tax credit, it will reduce the burden of taxes 
and, hopefully, prices.

## Question 18

**Q:** How does GST remove the cascading effect using input tax credit?

### Answer

GST removes the cascading effect of taxes, where tax is paid on tax, by introducing seamless Input Tax Credit (ITC) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 4].

Previously, the tax paid on material purchases could not be claimed from output tax, leading to the cascading effect [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 4]. With ITC, this changes. When a registered dealer buys a product or service, they pay taxes on the purchase. Later, when they make sales, tax is collected. Periodically, the tax paid on purchases (input tax) is adjusted against the tax collected on sales (output tax), and only the balance liability is paid to the government. This mechanism, known as the utilization of input tax credit, prevents tax from being paid multiple times on the same value at different stages of the supply chain [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 48].

9.Input Tax Credit in Detail
When you buy a product/service from a registered dealer 
you pay taxes on purchase, while making sales, tax is col-
lected and periodically the same is adjusted with the tax you 
already paid at time of purchase and balance liability of tax 
(tax on sales (minus) tax on purchase) is to be paid to the 
government. This mechanism is called utilisation of input tax 
credit (tax on purchase adjustment against tax liability on 
output i.e. sales).
Following are some of the conditions that need to be ad-
dressed for availing ITC:
1. Input credit is to be availed within one year:  Businesses 
will not be entitled to take input tax credit under GST law, in

the department.
Enjoy better reputation
How will Businesses be Benefited by Becoming
GST compliant?
The easiest way to understand this is through an example.
Ajay requires office stationery. He has shortlisted 2 sellers - 
ABC & XYZ.
ABC has a rating of 9 whereas XYZ’s rating is 6. Ajay hears 
from his good friend Vijay that the company XYZ does not 
file its GST returns on time resulting in input credit being 
blocked, while the company ABC is well rated and highly 
compliant.
Based on his friend’s suggestions and the vendor’s ratings, 
Ajay places an order with the company ABC.
Effect on buyer:
Buyers will look for sellers with higher rating which will en-
sure they can avail input tax credit faster.

there will be no tax applicable to B and input tax credit will 
be available to A.
Claiming Input Tax on Job Work
There are three different scenarios that can affect the ITC on 
job work:
1. Capital goods are sent for job work after the
appointed day
The principal can send capital goods to the job worker after 
the appointed day of GST implementation (July 1st) and 
these will have to be sent back within 3 years from the date 
of movement. Such goods will not be taxed to the
job worker.
For example: Let’s say A sends a machine to job worker B for 
paint work on 1 August 2017. If B sends the machine back to 
A by 1 August 2020 then there will be no tax applicable to B 
and input tax credit will be available to A.

## Question 19

**Q:** What is the difference between CGST, SGST, and IGST?

### Answer

The difference between CGST, SGST, and IGST lies in the nature of the transaction—whether it is an intra-state (within the same state) or inter-state (between different states) supply of goods or services.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax) and SGST (State Goods and Services Tax):**
    *   These taxes are levied on **intra-state sales**, meaning transactions where both the supplier and the recipient are located in the same state [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7], [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 14], [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 16].
    *   Both CGST and SGST apply simultaneously for such sales, each at a specific rate (e.g., if CGST is 9%, SGST is also 9%) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7].
    *   **Example:** If a manufacturer in Maharashtra sells goods to a dealer in Maharashtra, both CGST and SGST will apply [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7]. Similarly, if a supplier in Bangalore, Karnataka, sells goods to schools in Manipal, Karnataka, it's an intra-state supply, and SGST and CGST will be levied [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 14].

*   **IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax):**
    *   This tax is levied on **inter-state sales**, meaning transactions between different states [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7], [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 16].
    *   The IGST rate is typically the sum of CGST and SGST rates (e.g., if CGST is 9% and SGST is 9%, then IGST is 18%) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7].
    *   **Example:** If a dealer in Maharashtra sells goods to a trader in Rajasthan, it is an inter-state sale, and IGST at the rate of 18% will apply [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7].

In essence, the "place of supply" determines which tax is levied. GST is a destination-based or consumption-based tax, meaning the tax accrues to the state where the goods and services are consumed [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7], [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 16].

WHAT IS SGST , CGST , AND IGST?
Suppose goods worth INR 10,000 are sold by manufacturer A 
in Maharashtra to Dealer B in Maharashtra. B resells them to 
trader C in Rajasthan for INR 17,500. Trader C finally sells to 
End User D in Rajasthan for INR 30,000.
Suppose CGST= 9%, SGST=9%. Then, IGST= 9+9=18%
Since A is selling this to B in Maharashtra itself, it is an in-
tra-state sale and both CGST and SGST will apply, at the 
rate of 9% each.
B (Maharashtra) is selling to C (Rajasthan). Since it is an inter-
state sale, IGST at the rate of 18% will apply.
C (Rajasthan) is selling to D also in Rajasthan. Once again it 
is an intra-state sale and both CGST and SGST will apply, at 
the rate of 9% each.

the rate of 9% each.
*** Any IGST credit will first be applied to set off IGST 
then CGST . Balance will be applied to setoff SGST.
Since, GST is a consumption based tax, i.e., the state where 
the goods were consumed will collect GST . By that logic, Ma-
harashtra (where goods were sold) should not get any taxes. 
Rajasthan and Central both should have got (30,000 * 9%) = 
2,700 each instead of only 2,250.
Maharashtra (exporting state) will transfer to the Centre the 
credit of SGST of INR 900 used in payment of IGST .
The Centre will transfer to Rajasthan (importing state) 
INR 450 as IGST credit used.

tax structure.

Example 1: Determining Place of Supply for Intra-State Sup-
ply of Goods
Let us assume there is a supplier of craft products, Kloud 
Kreations Pvt. Ltd with the registered office in Bangalore, 
Karnataka. It supplies goods to schools in Manipal, Karna-
taka. Here, since the supplier as well as the recipient are 
located in same state i.e Karnataka, it will be counted as 
‘Intra-State Supply Of Goods’ and hence SGST and CGST will 
be levied.

3. Time, Place and Value of Supply under GST Explained
According to the law, the point of taxation means the point 
in time when goods have been deemed to be supplied or 
services have been deemed to be provided. The point of tax-
ation enables us to determine the rate of tax, value, and due 
dates for payment of taxes.
The liability to pay CGST / SGST will arise at the time of sup-
ply as determined for goods and services. There are separate 
provisions for time of supply for goods and time of supply for 
services. The liability to pay CGST / SGST on the services shall 
arise at the time of supply as determined by GST provisions.
How to Determine Time of Supply
The time of supply of goods/services shall be the earlier of
```

**Chunk 5** - data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf (Page 16)

```
Also, correct determination of place of supply will help us in 
knowing the incidence of tax. As if place of supply is deter-
mined as a place outside India, then tax will not have to be 
paid on that transaction
GST is destination based tax i.e consumption tax, which 
means tax will be levied where goods and services are con-
sumed and will accrue to that state. 
Under GST , there are three levels of Tax, IGST , CGST and 
SGST and based on the ‘’place of supply’’ so determined, 
the respective tax will be levied. IGST is levied where 
transaction is inter-state, and CGST and SGST are levied 
where the transaction is intra-state. For understanding 
Place of Supply for Services the following two concepts are 
very important namely:
location of the recipient of services

## Question 20

**Q:** In the shirt manufacturing example, what is the final tax-inclusive price before and after GST?

### Answer

Before GST, the final tax-inclusive price in the shirt manufacturing example was INR 214.5, due to the cascading effect of taxes where tax was paid on tax [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 4].

After GST, the final tax-inclusive price of the shirt was reduced to INR 187. This reduction is attributed to GST's benefits, such as reducing the cascading effect of taxes and allowing input tax credit [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 5].

STAGE 1
Say a shirt manufacturer pays INR 100 to buy raw materials. 
If the rate of taxes is set at 10%, and there is no profit or loss 
involved, then he has to pay INR 10 as tax. So, the final cost 
of the shirt now becomes INR (100+10=) 110.
STAGE 2
At the next stage, the wholesaler buys the shirt from the 
manufacturer at INR 110, and adds labels to it. When he is 
adding labels, he is adding value. Therefore his cost increas-
es by say INR 40. On top of this, he has to pay a 10% tax, and 
the final cost therefore becomes INR (110+40=) 150 + 10% 
tax = 165.

## Question 21

**Q:** What GST returns are required to be filed under the system?

### Answer

Under the GST system, various returns are required to be filed depending on the taxpayer's category and circumstances:

*   **Normal Taxpayer:**
    *   Three monthly returns and one annual return [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 32].
    *   The three monthly returns are GSTR-1, GSTR-2, and GSTR-3 [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 12].
        *   **GSTR-1:** Details of outward supplies of taxable goods and/or services effected [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 33].
        *   **GSTR-2:** Details of inward supplies of taxable goods and/or services effected claiming input tax credit [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 33].
        *   **GSTR-3:** Monthly return based on the finalization of outward and inward supplies details, along with the payment of the tax amount [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 33].

*   **Composition Supplier:**
    *   A quarterly return for compounding taxable persons [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 33].

*   **Non-Resident Foreign Taxable Person:**
    *   A specific return for Non-Resident foreign taxable persons [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 33].

*   **Taxable Person whose registration has been surrendered or cancelled:**
    *   **GSTR-10:** A Final Return [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 35].

*   **Person having UIN and claiming refund:**
    *   **GSTR-11:** Details of inward supplies to be furnished [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 35].

Separate returns are also required for taxpayers registered under the composition scheme, Input Service Distributors, and persons liable to deduct or collect tax (TDS/TCS) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 32].

5.GST Returns - How and When to File Them
A return is a document that a taxpayer is required to file as 
per the law with the tax administrative authorities. Under 
the GST law, a normal taxpayer will be required to furnish 
three returns monthly and one annual return. Similarly, 
there are separate returns for a taxpayer registered under the 
composition scheme, taxpayer registered as an Input Service 
Distributor, a person liable to deduct or collect the tax (TDS/

Goods and Services Tax, however, there is a flip-side to it. 
Businesses registering voluntarily under GST may have to 
face extra compliance and working capital liquidity. Some of 
these consequences are:
Multiple return filing: Businesses registered under Goods and 
Services Taxes are required to file three returns every month. 
These returns are GSTR-1, GSTR-2, GSTR-3 and include the 
details of all purchases, sales, and final tax liability after set-
ting off Input Tax Credit. Failure to file these returns will not 
only deny the input credit to our buyer but also attract pen-
alty. Further Compliance rating will get affected negatively.
Payment of tax liability: Once registered under GST , the 
supplier will have the additional responsibility of collecting

3.REGISTERING UNDER GST
Important Points to Remember when Now that we know the basics of GST calculation, the process 
of ITC claims and filing of returns, let us look at how a tax-
payer can register for GST . 
If you meet any of the conditions listed below, you should 
obtain your GST registration when the enrollment reopens 
again [GST is expected to apply from 1st July 2017]:
Your aggregate turnover in a financial year exceeds INR 20 
lakhs (INR 10 lakhs for Special category states)\
If your turnover includes supply of only those goods/services 
which are exempt under GST , this clause does not apply
To calculate this threshold, your turnover should include

## Question 22

**Q:** What is the definition of place of supply with an example?

### Answer

The "place of supply" means the place of supply as referred to in Chapter V of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 8].

The provided context does not include an example of the place of supply. It does, however, define important related concepts like the "location of the supplier of services" and "location of the recipient of services" which form the base for determining the place of supply in the case of services [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 16].

## Question 23

**Q:** What is the difference between a casual taxable person and a non-resident taxable person?

### Answer

Both a casual taxable person and a non-resident taxable person occasionally undertake transactions involving the supply of goods or services or both, whether as a principal, agent, or in any other capacity [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 2, 7].

The key difference lies in their location of business:

*   A **casual taxable person** is a person who undertakes such transactions in a State or a Union territory where they have no fixed place of business, but the context implies they would generally be operating within India [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 2].
*   A **non-resident taxable person**, on the other hand, is any person who undertakes such transactions but has no fixed place of business or residence **in India** [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 7].

## Question 24

**Q:** How is the value of supply determined in barter or exchange transactions?

### Answer

In barter or exchange transactions where consideration is not wholly in money, the value of supply is determined through a sequential process:

1.  **Open Market Value (OMV):** The value of supply will first be the Open Market Value (OMV) of such supply, defined as the amount fairly available in the open market [Source: GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24].

2.  **Monetary and Equivalent Non-Monetary Consideration:** If the Open Market Value is not available, the value of supply will be the sum of the total consideration received in money and any further amount in money that is equivalent to the consideration not in money, provided this amount is known at the time of supply [Source: GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24]. This means the monetary value of the partial consideration (in kind) is added to the monetary consideration [Source: GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24].

3.  **Like Kind and Quantity:** If the value cannot be determined using the above methods, it will be equivalent to that of goods or services of like kind and quantity. The taxable person can refer to similar goods or services to determine this value [Source: GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24].

4.  **Cost Method or Residual Method:** If the value is still not determinable under all the preceding clauses, it shall be the sum total of consideration in money and such further amount of money that is equivalent to consideration not in money, as determined on the basis of the Cost Method or Residual Method [Source: GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24].

These methods apply to innovative schemes where a buyer pays a partial amount in cash and the rest in kind, such as exchanging used goods for a new product [Source: GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24].

value of supply.
If the value is not determinable under all the above clause, 
the value shall be the sum total of consideration in money 
and such further amount of money that is equivalent to con-
sideration not in money as determined on the basis of Cost 
Method or Residual Method.
Value of Supply where Consideration is Not
Wholly in Money
Businesses operate in a dynamic model and we have wit-
nessed innovative schemes wherein a buyer is required to 
pay the partial amount in cash and the rest in kind, such as 
when exchanging used goods for a new product.
As a general principal, value of supply will be the amount of 
consideration received in money from the buyer.

supply shall be: 
Open Market Value of such supply. OMV will be the amount 
which is fairly available in open market.
If the open market value is not available, the value of supply 
will be the sum of the total of consideration in money and 
any such further amount in money as is equivalent to the 
consideration not in money if such amount is known at the 
time of supply. In simple words the monetary value of partial 
consideration will be added to monetary consideration, to 
sum up to total consideration.
If the value is not determinable under the points above, the 
value of supply of goods or service or both will be equivalent 
to that of like kind and quantity. Here the taxable person can 
refer to similar goods or services or both for determining the 
value of supply.

## Question 25

**Q:** How are vouchers treated for determining the time of supply?

### Answer

In the case of supply of vouchers by a supplier, the time of supply is determined as follows:
*   If the supply is identifiable at the point of issue of the voucher, the time of supply is the date of issue of the voucher [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 15], [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 16].
*   In all other cases, the time of supply is the date of redemption of the voucher [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 15], [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 16].
