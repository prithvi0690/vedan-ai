B (Maharashtra) is selling to C (Rajasthan). Since it is an inter-

the rate of 9% each.
*** Any IGST credit will first be applied to set off IGST 
then CGST . Balance will be applied to setoff SGST.
Since, GST is a consumption based tax, i.e., the state where 
the goods were consumed will collect GST . By that logic, Ma-
harashtra (where goods were sold) should not get any taxes.

B (Maharashtra) is selling to C (Rajasthan). Since it is an inter-
state sale, IGST at the rate of 18% will apply.
C (Rajasthan) is selling to D also in Rajasthan. Once again it 
is an intra-state sale and both CGST and SGST will apply, at 
the rate of 9% each.
*** Any IGST credit will first be applied to set off IGST 
then CGST . Balance will be applied to setoff SGST.
Since, GST is a consumption based tax, i.e., the state where 
the goods were consumed will collect GST . By that logic, Ma-
harashtra (where goods were sold) should not get any taxes.

WHAT IS SGST , CGST , AND IGST?
Suppose goods worth INR 10,000 are sold by manufacturer A 
in Maharashtra to Dealer B in Maharashtra. B resells them to 
trader C in Rajasthan for INR 17,500. Trader C finally sells to 
End User D in Rajasthan for INR 30,000.
Suppose CGST= 9%, SGST=9%. Then, IGST= 9+9=18%
Since A is selling this to B in Maharashtra itself, it is an in-
tra-state sale and both CGST and SGST will apply, at the 
rate of 9% each.

## Question 8

**Q:** How does the CGST Act define a taxable person?

### Answer

Based on the provided context, the CGST Act, as excerpted, defines a "casual taxable person" but does not explicitly provide a general definition for "taxable person."

A "casual taxable person" is defined as a person who occasionally undertakes transactions involving the supply of goods or services or both in the course or furtherance of business, whether as principal, agent, or in any other capacity, in a State or a Union territory where they have no fixed place of business [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 2]. This definition is also reiterated in the GST E-Book [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 10].

To understand GST , it is important that we understand 
the current indirect taxation system. Direct taxes such as 
income tax are borne by the person liable to pay the tax; 
this means that the tax burden cannot be shifted to any-
one else. The liability of an indirect taxes on the other hand, 
can be shifted to another person. So, the person liable to pay 
the tax can collect the tax from someone else and then pay it 
to the government; thus shifting the tax burden. The GST tax 
falls in this category.

### Answer

According to the CGST Act, the expression "supply" includes:
*   All forms of supply of goods or services or both, such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease, or disposal, made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 12].
*   Import of services for a consideration, whether or not in the course or furtherance of business [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 12].
*   The activities specified in Schedule I, made or agreed to be made without a consideration [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 12].
*   The activities to be treated as supply of goods or supply of services as referred to in Schedule II [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 12].

means tax will be levied where goods and services are con-
sumed and will accrue to that state. 
Under GST , there are three levels of Tax, IGST , CGST and 
SGST and based on the ‘’place of supply’’ so determined, 
the respective tax will be levied. IGST is levied where 
transaction is inter-state, and CGST and SGST are levied 
where the transaction is intra-state. For understanding 
Place of Supply for Services the following two concepts are 
very important namely:

## Question 11

**Q:** Which section explains the composition levy?

### Answer

The "Composition Levy" is explained under the heading "7.Composition Levy" in the GST Guidebook-ClearTax, which details the Composition Scheme under GST. This scheme was introduced to help startups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) comply with tax provisions. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 40] The CGST Act, 2017 also refers to the "Composition levy" in various contexts, such as eligibility criteria for the scheme [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 13] and stating that tax paid under the composition levy is not included in "tax payable" for input tax credit purposes [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 5].

## Question 12

**Q:** What are the thresholds for compulsory GST registration?

### Answer

For compulsory GST registration, a person should obtain registration if their aggregate turnover in a financial year exceeds INR 20 lakhs. This threshold is reduced to INR 10 lakhs for "Special category states" [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 9].

The following states are assigned special status and have the INR 10 lakh threshold:
*   Arunachal Pradesh
*   Assam
*   Jammu & Kashmir
*   Manipur
*   Meghalaya
*   Mizoram
*   Nagaland
*   Sikkim
*   Tripura
*   Himachal Pradesh
*   Uttarakhand [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 47]

To calculate this threshold, the aggregate turnover should include the value of all taxable supplies, exempt supplies, export of goods and/or services, and inter-state supplies made by a person having the same PAN. However, if the turnover consists only of goods/services exempt under GST, this clause does not apply [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 9, Page: 4].

Other Notable Points Regarding Registration
A person with multiple business verticals in a state will need 
to obtain a separate registration for each business vertical.
PAN is mandatory to apply for GST registration (except for 
non-resident person who can get GST registration on the 
basis of other documents).
A registration which has been rejected under CGST Act/SGST 
Act shall also stand rejected for the purpose of SGST/CGST 
Act.

non-resident taxable person.
Here are the rules for registration for these persons:
     Registration shall be valid for 90 days.
     It can be further extended by 90 days.
     An advance deposit of tax liability for the period of regis

applicable to a registered taxable person will similarly apply 
to such a voluntarily registered person also, i.e. he will be 
treated as a normal taxable person.
For example, assume there is a small grocery dealer with a 
limited turnover of Rs. 12-15 lakh. Such a dealer may not be 
required to register under GST . However, he may be sup-
plying inputs to a nearby restaurant which has a turnover 
exceeding Rs. 20 lakh, is registered as a normal taxpayer, and 
is thus eligible for input credit. In such a scenario, a small 
dealer may register voluntarily to pass on the benefit of input

as baseline for using HSN codes of 4 digits. The use of HSN 
codes will make GST systematic and globally accepted. 
For taxpayers with turnover between INR 1.5 Crores and INR 
5 Crores in the preceding financial year, HSN codes may be 
specified only at 2 digit chapter level as an optional exercise 
to start with. From the second year of GST operations, men-
tioning 2 digit chapter level HSN Code will be mandatory 
for all taxpayers whose turnover in previous financial year

Goods and Services Tax, however, there is a flip-side to it. 
Businesses registering voluntarily under GST may have to 
face extra compliance and working capital liquidity. Some of 
these consequences are:
Multiple return filing: Businesses registered under Goods and 
Services Taxes are required to file three returns every month. 
These returns are GSTR-1, GSTR-2, GSTR-3 and include the 
details of all purchases, sales, and final tax liability after set-
ting off Input Tax Credit. Failure to file these returns will not

small businesses who do not have the resources to be fully 
compliant; at least in the initial days. GST is a completely 
new tax regime and businesses will inevitably be prone to 
errors. Errors, delays and non-compliance will affect the ven-
dor’s rating, and therefore the business may suffer.
On the other hand, compliant vendors will be at an advan-
tage as they will be easily distinguished from their competi-
tors. This will also prove beneficial to the large players who 
have more resources at their disposal.

## Question 13

**Q:** What is the meaning of aggregate turnover according to the Act?

### Answer

According to the Act, "aggregate turnover" means the aggregate value of all taxable supplies (excluding the value of inward supplies on which tax is payable by a person on reverse charge basis), exempt supplies, exports of goods or services or both, and inter-State supplies of persons having the same Permanent Account Number. This is to be computed on an all-India basis but excludes central tax, State tax, Union territory tax, integrated tax, and cess. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 1, Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 1]

Additionally, for the purposes of a specific section, "aggregate turnover" shall include all supplies made by the taxable person, whether on his own account or made on behalf of all his principals. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 24]

How Does Aggregate Turnover Affect the Status Quo?
It’s been highly anticipated that GST is going to expand 
the taxpayer base in India. The concept of aggregate turn-
over may also attract businesses which otherwise may not 
be genuinely required to register. This has been a concern for 
a while, however, the government is reluctant to make any 
change in existing provisions. It is important to note that 
just by registering, the exempt businesses will not have 
to pay taxes. But registering will mean that they will have to

## Question 14

**Q:** What are the conditions for claiming input tax credit?

### Answer

To claim input tax credit, a registered person must meet several conditions and restrictions:

**General Conditions for Eligibility:**
*   Every registered person is entitled to take credit of input tax charged on any supply of goods or services or both, provided they are used or intended to be used in the course or furtherance of their business. This amount is credited to the electronic credit ledger [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 18, 7].
*   The input tax credit, as self-assessed in the return of a registered person, is credited to their electronic credit ledger [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 36, 10].

**Specific Conditions and Requirements:**
*   Such inputs or goods must be used or intended to be used for making taxable supplies under the GST Act [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 84, 6; data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 42, 9].
*   The registered person is not paying tax under section 10 (composition scheme) [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 84, 6].

*   The goods must be eligible for input tax credit under the GST regime [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 42, 9].
*   Customers can only claim input tax credit if their suppliers are able to provide it [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 44, 2].

**Circumstances Where Input Tax Credit is NOT Allowed:**
*   Where the registered person has claimed depreciation on the tax component of the cost of capital goods and plant and machinery under the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 19, 3].
*   After the due date of furnishing the return under section 39 for the month of September following the end of the financial year for any invoice or debit note [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 19, 3].
*   Where the amount of credit is not admissible as input tax credit under this Act [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 82, 4].

## Question 15

**Q:** What transactions are blocked for input tax credit?

### Answer

Input tax credit (ITC) is blocked in several transactions and circumstances:

*   **Depreciation Claimed on Tax Component:** If a registered person has claimed depreciation on the tax component of the cost of capital goods and plant and machinery under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the input tax credit on that tax component is not allowed. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 19]
*   **Time Limit for Claiming ITC:** A registered person is not entitled to take input tax credit in respect of any invoice or debit note for supply of goods or services or both after the due date of furnishing the return under section 39 for the month of September following the end of the financial year. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 19]
*   **Composition Scheme Opt-in:** If a registered person opts to pay tax under section 10 (composition scheme), they cannot claim input tax credit, even if they make taxable purchases. The buyer of such goods also does not get any credit of tax paid. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 21], [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 43]
*   **Credit Not Admissible:** Input tax credit is not allowed where the amount of credit is generally not admissible as input tax credit under the Act. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 82]
*   **Failure to Furnish Returns (Existing Law):** Credit is not allowed if the registered person has not furnished all the returns required under the existing law for the six months immediately preceding the appointed date. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 82]
*   **Exempt Goods (Existing Law):** Credit is not allowed if the amount relates to goods manufactured and cleared under such exemption notifications as are notified by the Government. [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 82]
*   **Wrongful Availment/Utilization:** Taking or utilizing input tax credit without actual receipt of goods or services (either fully or partially) in contravention of the Act or rules, or distributing input tax credit in contravention of section 20, is considered irregular or wrongful availment.

## Question 16

**Q:** What is the valuation rule for supplies between related persons?

### Answer

In the case of supply between related persons under GST, the value of supply is determined by the following hierarchy:

1.  **Open Market Value (OMV):** This is the primary method, referring to the amount fairly available in the open market. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 25]
2.  **Value of supply of goods or services of like, kind and quantity:** If the OMV is not available, the taxable person can use similar goods or services as a reference. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 25]
3.  **Cost Method or Residual Method:** If the value cannot be determined by the first two methods, it shall be determined by either the Cost Method or Residual Method. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 25]

In case of supply between such related person under GST , 
value of supply will be:
The Open Market Value (OMV) of such supply. OMV will be the 
amount which is fairly available in open market.
If the open market value is not available, it will be the val-
ue of supply of goods or services of like, kind and quantity. 
Here, the taxable person can use as reference similar goods 
or services or both for determining the value of supply.
If the value is not determinable in the above two cases it 
shall be determined by either by the Cost Method or Residual 
Method.

consideration will be added to monetary consideration, to 
sum up to total consideration.
If the value is not determinable under the points above, the 
value of supply of goods or service or both will be equivalent 
to that of like kind and quantity. Here the taxable person can

## Question 17

**Q:** What is the cascading effect of taxes described in the GST e-book?

### Answer

The cascading effect of taxes, as described in the GST e-book, refers to the problem in the previous indirect tax structure where "when you buy something, you pay a tax on tax itself" [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 3]. One of the benefits of GST is that it will reduce this cascading effect of taxes [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 5] and simplify indirect taxation by removing it [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 1].

To understand GST , it is important that we understand 
the current indirect taxation system. Direct taxes such as 
income tax are borne by the person liable to pay the tax; 
this means that the tax burden cannot be shifted to any-
one else. The liability of an indirect taxes on the other hand, 
can be shifted to another person. So, the person liable to pay 
the tax can collect the tax from someone else and then pay it 
to the government; thus shifting the tax burden. The GST tax 
falls in this category.

no more arbitrariness in tax rates.
Multi-stage: GST is levied each stage in the supply 
chain, where a transaction takes place. 
Value-addition: This is the process of addition to the 
value of a product/ service at each stage of its pro-
duction, exclusive of initial costs. Under GST , the tax is 
levied only on the value added. This is done through 
Destination-based consumption: Unlike the current 
indirect taxes, GST will be collected at the point of 
consumption. The taxing authority with appropriate

to the government; thus shifting the tax burden. The GST tax 
falls in this category.
The current indirect tax structure, which comprises of so 
many different taxes, can be classified as:
Central taxes: levied by the Central govt (includes Central 
Sales Tax, Excise Duty etc.)
State taxes: levied by the various state govts (VAT , Service 
Tax, Octroi)
1.GST VS CURRENT INDIRECT TAX STRUCTURE
The current indirect tax has one major problem - 
the casacading effect. When you buysomething, you pay a 
tax on tax itself.
Let’s understand this with a hypothetical numerical 
example

2.SO, WHY IS GST A BIG DEAL?
GST is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based 
consumption tax on levied at every stage of value addition 
in the lifecycle of a product. To understand this better, let us 
look at each of the terms in detail:
Comprehensive: GST will subsume all of the current 
indirect taxes. Plus, by bringing in a unified taxation 
system, across the country, it will ensure that there is 
no more arbitrariness in tax rates.
Multi-stage: GST is levied each stage in the supply

In the end, every time an individual was able to claim in-
put tax credit, the sale price for him reduced and the cost 
price for the person buying his product reduced because 
of a lower tax liability. The final value of the shirt also 
therefore reduced from INR 214.5 to INR 187, thus reducing 
the tax burden on the final customer.
So essentially, GST is going to have a two-pronged benefit. 
One, it will reduce the cascading effect of taxes, and second, 
by allowing input tax credit, it will reduce the burden of taxes 
and, hopefully, prices.

When is Tax Levied?
A taxable event such as manufacture, sale and provision of a 
good has to occur for tax to be collected. Under the current 
system, each taxable event is subject to multiple taxes such 
as excise, VAT/ CST and service tax. But under GST , products 
will no longer have multiple taxes, and will not incur excise 
duty as well as VAT at different points of time. There will 
no longer be any difference between goods and services in 
terms of taxation.
An example of this is when we go out to eat at a restaurant.

terms of taxation.
An example of this is when we go out to eat at a restaurant. 
Earlier, the customer paid both VAT and service tax on a 
single bill, but after GST is implemented there will be a single 
tax charge on the bill amount. 
This leads us to an important concept in GST - Time, Place, 
and Value of Supply of goods and services. Let us look at 
these provisions in detail in the next chapter.

rules provide that if the transaction value is not available 
then the value for the good/service would be considered 
as the transaction value of good/service of same kind and 
quality.
The Final Word
GST is more than just a tax change. It is also a ‘behaviour 
change’ and its successful implementation will depend on 
how well we as a nation adapt to the new requirements of 
doing business. Post the initial teething troubles, it is expect-
ed that GST will bring in much good for all sectors, including 
the FMCG industry.

an invoice or making a payment in case of supply of goods/

to ensure the tax is collected at the earliest point of time.

## Question 18

**Q:** How does GST remove the cascading effect using input tax credit?

### Answer

GST removes the cascading effect of taxes by allowing input tax credit. This mechanism allows a business to adjust the tax it has already paid on purchases against the tax liability on its sales [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 48].

The benefit of this system is that when an individual claims input tax credit, their sale price is reduced. This, in turn, reduces the cost price for the person buying their product because of a lower tax liability. Ultimately, this leads to a reduction in the tax burden on the final customer and potentially lower prices [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 5].

compel people to be fully GST compliant and on time with 
uploading invoices and other necessary documents.
Under GST , a person can claim input tax credit in GSTR-2 
(return with purchase details for the month) only when the 
seller has also filed his GSTR-1 (return with monthly sales de-
tails), and the details on both these forms match or reconcile 
with each other.
Now, under the current regime, businesses often delay re-
turn filing and payment of taxes to gain time. Continuing 
this practice under GST will result in delay in input tax credit

When you buy a product/service from a registered dealer 
you pay taxes on purchase, while making sales, tax is col-
lected and periodically the same is adjusted with the tax you 
already paid at time of purchase and balance liability of tax 
(tax on sales (minus) tax on purchase) is to be paid to the 
government. This mechanism is called utilisation of input tax 
credit (tax on purchase adjustment against tax liability on 
output i.e. sales).
Following are some of the conditions that need to be ad-
```

```
In the end, every time an individual was able to claim in-
put tax credit, the sale price for him reduced and the cost 
price for the person buying his product reduced because 
of a lower tax liability. The final value of the shirt also 
therefore reduced from INR 214.5 to INR 187, thus reducing 
the tax burden on the final customer.
So essentially, GST is going to have a two-pronged benefit. 
One, it will reduce the cascading effect of taxes, and second, 
by allowing input tax credit, it will reduce the burden of taxes 
and, hopefully, prices.

this practice under GST will result in delay in input tax credit 
across the chain and severely affect the working capital of 
businesses. The rating system will prevent the delay of credit 
for bona fide buyers due to the non-compliance of certain 
persons.
Input Tax Credit on Reverse Charge
Tax paid on reverse charge basis will be available for input 
tax credit if such goods and/or services are used, or will be 
used, for business. The service recipient (i.e., who pays re-
verse tax) can thus avail input tax credit.

Claiming Input Tax on Job Work
There are three different scenarios that can affect the ITC on 
job work:
1. Capital goods are sent for job work after the
appointed day
The principal can send capital goods to the job worker after 
the appointed day of GST implementation (July 1st) and 
these will have to be sent back within 3 years from the date 
of movement. Such goods will not be taxed to the
job worker.

To understand GST , it is important that we understand 
the current indirect taxation system. Direct taxes such as 
income tax are borne by the person liable to pay the tax; 
this means that the tax burden cannot be shifted to any-
one else. The liability of an indirect taxes on the other hand, 
can be shifted to another person. So, the person liable to pay 
the tax can collect the tax from someone else and then pay it 
to the government; thus shifting the tax burden. The GST tax 
falls in this category.

## Question 19

**Q:** What is the difference between CGST, SGST, and IGST?

### Answer

The difference between CGST, SGST, and IGST lies in the nature of the transaction, specifically whether it is conducted within the same state (intra-state) or between different states (inter-state).

*   **CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax) and SGST (State Goods and Services Tax):** These are levied on **intra-state** transactions, meaning when the supplier and the recipient are located in the same state [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 14, 16]. For example, if a manufacturer in Maharashtra sells to a dealer also in Maharashtra, both CGST and SGST will apply, typically at a rate of 9% each [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7]. Similarly, if a company in Karnataka supplies goods to schools in Manipal, Karnataka, SGST and CGST will be levied [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 14]. The liability to pay CGST/SGST on services arises at the time of supply [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 13, 8].

*   **IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax):** This is levied on **inter-state** transactions, meaning when the supply of goods or services occurs between different states [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 16]. The IGST rate is the sum of CGST and SGST rates; for instance, if CGST is 9% and SGST is 9%, then IGST is 18% [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7]. An example is when a dealer in Maharashtra sells to a trader in Rajasthan, IGST at 18% will apply [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7].

GST is a destination-based or consumption tax, which means the tax will be levied where goods and services are consumed and will accrue to that state [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 16].

rate of 9% each.
B (Maharashtra) is selling to C (Rajasthan). Since it is an inter-
state sale, IGST at the rate of 18% will apply.
C (Rajasthan) is selling to D also in Rajasthan. Once again it 
is an intra-state sale and both CGST and SGST will apply, at 
the rate of 9% each.
*** Any IGST credit will first be applied to set off IGST 
then CGST . Balance will be applied to setoff SGST.
Since, GST is a consumption based tax, i.e., the state where 
the goods were consumed will collect GST . By that logic, Ma-
harashtra (where goods were sold) should not get any taxes.

trader C in Rajasthan for INR 17,500. Trader C finally sells to 
End User D in Rajasthan for INR 30,000.

paid on that transaction
GST is destination based tax i.e consumption tax, which 
means tax will be levied where goods and services are con-
sumed and will accrue to that state. 
Under GST , there are three levels of Tax, IGST , CGST and 
SGST and based on the ‘’place of supply’’ so determined, 
the respective tax will be levied. IGST is levied where 
transaction is inter-state, and CGST and SGST are levied 
where the transaction is intra-state. For understanding

How to Determine Time of Supply
The time of supply of goods/services shall be the earlier of 
the following dates:
the date of issuing invoice (or the last day by which invoice 
should have been issued)
OR
the date of receipt of payment, whichever is earlier
If the supplier of taxable goods/service receives an amount

as per section 19 of IGST Act and section 70 of CGST Act
Where wrong taxes have been paid on the basis of the wrong 
classification, refund will have to be claimed by the taxpayer
The taxpayer will have to pay the correct tax along with inter-
est for delay on the basis of revised/correct classification
Also, correct determination of place of supply will help us in 
knowing the incidence of tax. As if place of supply is deter-
mined as a place outside India, then tax will not have to be 
paid on that transaction

3. Time, Place and Value of Supply under GST Explained
According to the law, the point of taxation means the point 
in time when goods have been deemed to be supplied or 
services have been deemed to be provided. The point of tax-
ation enables us to determine the rate of tax, value, and due 
dates for payment of taxes.
The liability to pay CGST / SGST will arise at the time of sup-
ply as determined for goods and services. There are separate 
provisions for time of supply for goods and time of supply for

tation of GST . Due to the smoother supply chain manage-
ment , payment of tax, claiming input credit, removal of CST 
under the GST regime there will be cost reduction in terms of 
transportation and storage of goods. It is expected that the 
reduction in cost and taxes would make the consumer
goods cheaper.
Stock Transfers
Stock transfers outside the State will be subject to GST . It 
is unclear whether stock transfers within the State will also 
be subject to GST . It is to be noted that the GST framework 
was intended to tax only inter-state stock transfers, and not

## Question 20

**Q:** In the shirt manufacturing example, what is the final tax-inclusive price before and after GST?

### Answer

In the shirt manufacturing example:
*   The final tax-inclusive price **before GST** was INR 214.5. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 4], [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 7]
*   The final tax-inclusive price **after GST** was INR 187. [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 5]

STAGE 1
Say a shirt manufacturer pays INR 100 to buy raw materials. 
If the rate of taxes is set at 10%, and there is no profit or loss 
involved, then he has to pay INR 10 as tax. So, the final cost 
of the shirt now becomes INR (100+10=) 110.
STAGE 2
At the next stage, the wholesaler buys the shirt from the 
manufacturer at INR 110, and adds labels to it. When he is 
adding labels, he is adding value. Therefore his cost increas-
es by say INR 40. On top of this, he has to pay a 10% tax, and

In the GST regime, the tax collection event will be the earliest 
of the dates as given above. The various events like issuing 
an invoice or making a payment in case of supply of goods/
services or completion of event, in case of supply of service 
triggering the tax levy, confirms that the government wants 
to ensure the tax is collected at the earliest point of time. 
This will be altogether a new concept for the current VAT and 
central excise taxpayers.

the value of the item keeps increasing every time
this happens.
GST aims to solve this problem by introducing seam-
less Input Tax Credit (ITC). Today, the tax that you pay 
on material purchases cannot be claimed from output 
tax. This is set to change with ITC.

Multi-stage: GST is levied each stage in the supply

Value-addition: This is the process of addition to the

duction, exclusive of initial costs. Under GST , the tax is 
levied only on the value added. This is done through 
Destination-based consumption: Unlike the current 
indirect taxes, GST will be collected at the point of 
consumption. The taxing authority with appropriate

but the open market value of the laptop is not known, the 
value of the supply of laptop is INR 44,000.
This discount was not known at the time of supply, and so it 
cannot be claimed as a deduction from the transaction value 
for GST calculation. So the invoice will be same as above.

es by say INR 40. On top of this, he has to pay a 10% tax, and 
the final cost therefore becomes INR (110+40=) 150 + 10% 
tax = 165.
STAGE 3
Now, the retailer pays INR 165 to buy the shirt from the 
wholesaler because the tax liability had passed on to him. He 
has to package the shirt, and when he does that, he is adding 
value again. This time, let’s say his value add is INR 30. Now 
when he sells the shirt, he adds this value plus the VAT he has 
to pay the government to the final cost. So the cost of the 
shirt becomes INR 214.5 Let’s see a breakup for this:

If the second condition is not fulfilled then the supply is 
treated as a Mixed Supply.
Mixed supply
Mixed supply under GST means two or more individual sup-
plies of goods or services, or any combination, made togeth-
er with each other by a taxable person for a single price. Each 
of these items can be supplied separately and is not depen-
dent on any other.
It shall not be a mixed supply if these items are supplied 
separately.
For tax under GST , a mixed supply comprising two or more 
supplies shall be treated as supply of that item which has the 
highest rate of tax.
```

Currently the taxes are calculated on the value of
goods/services:
Valuation of supply under GST
GST will be charged on the ‘transaction value’ . Transaction 
value is the price actually paid (or payable) for the supply of 
goods/services between unrelated parties (i.e., price is the 
sole consideration).

terms of taxation.
An example of this is when we go out to eat at a restaurant. 
Earlier, the customer paid both VAT and service tax on a 
single bill, but after GST is implemented there will be a single 
tax charge on the bill amount. 
This leads us to an important concept in GST - Time, Place, 
and Value of Supply of goods and services. Let us look at 
these provisions in detail in the next chapter.

## Question 21

**Q:** What GST returns are required to be filed under the system?

### Answer

Under the GST system, the required returns vary based on the type of taxpayer:

*   **For a normal taxpayer:**
    *   Three monthly returns: GSTR-1, GSTR-2, and GSTR-3. These include details of all purchases, sales, and the final tax liability after setting off Input Tax Credit [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 12].
    *   GSTR-1 specifically covers monthly sales details, while GSTR-2 covers purchase details for the month [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 58].
    *   One annual return [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 32, Page: 44].
    *   This totals a minimum of 37 returns in a whole year (three monthly and one yearly consolidated) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 44].

*   **For taxpayers under the composition scheme:**
    *   One return in each quarter [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 44].

*   **For specific situations:**
    *   **GST R-10 (Final Return):** Filed by a taxable person whose registration has been surrendered or cancelled [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 35].
    *   **GST R-11:** Filed by a person having a Unique Identification Number (UIN) and claiming a refund, providing details of inward supplies [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 35].
    *   There are also separate returns for an Input Service Distributor and a person liable to deduct or collect tax (TDS/TCS) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 32].

All these returns are required to be filed digitally online through a common portal provided by GSTN [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 35].

5.GST Returns - How and When to File Them
A return is a document that a taxpayer is required to file as 
per the law with the tax administrative authorities. Under 
the GST law, a normal taxpayer will be required to furnish 
three returns monthly and one annual return. Similarly, 
there are separate returns for a taxpayer registered under the 
composition scheme, taxpayer registered as an Input Service 
Distributor, a person liable to deduct or collect the tax (TDS/
TCS)

Businesses registering voluntarily under GST may have to

these consequences are:
Multiple return filing: Businesses registered under Goods and 
Services Taxes are required to file three returns every month. 
These returns are GSTR-1, GSTR-2, GSTR-3 and include the

ting off Input Tax Credit. Failure to file these returns will not

Under GST , a person can claim input tax credit in GSTR-2 
(return with purchase details for the month) only when the 
seller has also filed his GSTR-1 (return with monthly sales de-
tails), and the details on both these forms match or reconcile 
with each other.
Now, under the current regime, businesses often delay re-
turn filing and payment of taxes to gain time. Continuing 
this practice under GST will result in delay in input tax credit

## Question 22

**Q:** What is the definition of place of supply with an example?

### Answer

"Place of supply" means the place of supply as referred to in Chapter V of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act [Source: data/raw\cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 8].

More specifically:
*   In general, for services, the place of supply will be the location of the service recipient, provided the recipient is a registered person. If the service is provided to an unregistered person, the place of supply will be the location of the service recipient (if the address is available on record) or the location of the service provider (if the recipient's location is not available) [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 19].
*   For the supply of goods, the place of supply is considered the registered place of business of the recipient [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 14].

**Example for Intra-State Supply of Goods:**
Let's consider Kloud Kreations Pvt. Ltd, a supplier of craft products with its registered office in Bangalore, Karnataka. Kloud Kreations supplies goods to schools in Manipal, Karnataka. In this example, since both the supplier and the recipient are in Karnataka, it is an intra-state supply of goods [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 14].

on record)

## Question 23

**Q:** What is the difference between a casual taxable person and a non-resident taxable person?

### Answer

A casual taxable person and a non-resident taxable person both occasionally undertake transactions involving the supply of goods or services or both in a taxable territory where they do not have a fixed place of business. The key difference lies in the geographical scope of where they lack a fixed place of business:

*   **Casual Taxable Person:** This is a person who occasionally supplies goods or services in a **State or a Union territory** where they have no fixed place of business [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 2].
*   **Non-Resident Taxable Person:** This refers to a person who occasionally supplies goods or services in a taxable territory where they have no fixed place of business **in India** [Source: GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 10]. The CGST Act further defines a non-resident taxable person as someone who has no fixed place of business or residence in India [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 7].

Both categories of persons are required to be registered under the CGST Act [Source: cgst-act_2017.pdf, Page: 24].

## Question 24

**Q:** How is the value of supply determined in barter or exchange transactions?

### Answer

In transactions where the consideration for a supply is not wholly in money (such as barter or exchange), the value of the supply is determined by the following methods, in order of priority:

1.  **Open Market Value (OMV)**: The value of supply shall be the Open Market Value of such supply, which is the amount fairly available in the open market [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24].
2.  **Monetary Equivalent**: If the OMV is not available, the value of supply will be the sum of the total consideration in money and any such further amount in money as is equivalent to the consideration not in money, provided this amount is known at the time of supply [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24, 9].
3.  **Like Kind and Quantity**: If the value is not determinable under the above points, the value of supply of goods or services or both will be equivalent to that of like kind and quantity. Taxable persons can refer to similar goods or services or both for determining this value [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24, 9].
4.  **Cost or Residual Method**: If the value is not determinable under all the above clauses, the value shall be the sum total of consideration in money and such further amount of money that is equivalent to consideration not in money as determined on the basis of the Cost Method or Residual Method [Source: data/raw\GST_E-Book.pdf, Page: 24].
